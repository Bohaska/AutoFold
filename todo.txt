High priority:
- Testing
    - Error handling, edge cases, all the good stuff
- Support more than BC and MC markets 


Medium priority:
- should make sure two simultaneous updates from api to db from different sources only writes most current info (check for API-side timestamps if present)
- Utilities
    - cpmm calculator:
    https://github.com/JRPdata/wastebook/blob/main/calculate_bet.ipynb
    - other stuff like total traders in a market
- Backplay
    - simulate automation on old data for testing
    - also an option to simulate on new realtime data, fake placing bets
- Better logging all around.
- Every thread should use signals instead of class attributes (self.running) for shutdown
- Add check in automationbot to only shut down once

Low priority:
- Read dumps (is this even necessary?)
- Supabase Socket (probably won't do this since it will be removed)

Done:
- rename to autofold
- Document database tables
- Main interface is Bot class, register strategies with it
- Rate Limiting
- Rename strategies to automations
- should be able to add automations whenever
- Specify db filepath
- Redo subscriber
    - Coagulate multiple subscriptions into one and modify polling times
    - threadsafe job registry
    - Better docstrings
    - update user info becomes update user
